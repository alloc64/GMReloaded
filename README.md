What is GM?

GM was C/C++ based game written in 201 while I was on high-school. 
@endy007 was the guy behind the graphics and most of the gameplay logic.

In 2014 I´ve started porting original code to Unity, and in 2016 we published it as almost play-able multiplayer game, in EA on Steam.
Since then, I´ve run out of a free-time and game was stuck in this state.


I´ve decided to opensource this project as I quit doing gamedev and it would be a shame to let the code disappear in deleted backups.
